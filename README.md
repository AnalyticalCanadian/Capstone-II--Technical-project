# Capstone-II--Technical-project
Creating functions and finding out insightful information
his presentation explores regression analysis, a powerful statistical technique for predicting healthcare outcomes and identifying trends in healthcare data.
By understanding relationships between variables, regression analysis helps healthcare professionals improve decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and predict patient risk.
Healthcare data is increasingly complex.
Regression analysis helps us extract meaningful insights from this data, leading to better patient care.
Presentation Candidate:

I will use a real-world healthcare dataset (e.g., hospital readmission rates) to demonstrate regression analysis.
The data will showcase the technique's application in predicting patient readmission risk based on various factors.
Technical Technique Demonstration:

We'll break down the steps of regression analysis:
Defining variables: Identifying factors influencing the outcome (e.g., readmission).
Choosing the right regression model: Selecting the appropriate model (linear, logistic) based on the data and outcome.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the data and evaluating its accuracy.
The demonstration will showcase how regression models predict readmission risk for new patients.
