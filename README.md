# Capstone-II--Technical-project
### INTRODUCTION ***
This presentation focuses on predicting flight prices using regression analysis techniques.
The ability to accurately forecast flight prices is crucial in the travel industry to optimize revenue and assist travelers in making informed decisions.
The objectives of this presentation are to demonstrate the application of regression analysis in predicting flight prices, discuss the importance of accurate price prediction in the airline industry, and showcase the potential benefits of implementing such techniques.
### Background ***
The current state of technology in the domain involves traditional methods of pricing flights based on historical data, demand forecasting, and market trends.
Challenges include the dynamic nature of flight prices influenced by various factors such as demand fluctuations, fuel costs, competition, and external events. However, these challenges also present opportunities for leveraging advanced analytical techniques to improve price prediction accuracy.

Sample Data Selection
Criteria for selecting sample data: The sample data comprises historical flight records including attributes such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure time, arrival time, duration, total stops, additional information, and price.
Sources of sample data: The dataset is sourced from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/princefrancis64/flight-price-prediction).
Relevance of the data to the demonstration: The sample data is relevant as it represents real-world flight booking scenarios and provides the necessary attributes for training and testing regression models for price prediction.

### Technical Technique Demonstration ***
Description of the technical technique: Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (flight price) and one or more independent variables (flight attributes). In this demonstration, I will utilize regression models such as Linear Regression.
Steps for applying the technique to the sample data:
Data preprocessing: Extract relevant features, handle missing values, and convert duration to numerical format.
Model selection: Will choose appropriate regression models.
Training the model: Train selected regression models on the training data.
The expected outcome is to build regression models that accurately predict flight prices, which can assist airlines in dynamic pricing strategies, revenue optimization, and providing customers with competitive fares.

### Conclusion ***
Through this presentation, we aim to demonstrate the application of regression analysis in predicting flight prices, highlighting its significance in the airline industry and potential benefits for stakeholders.
Encourage the audience to explore and implement regression analysis techniques in their respective domains for data-driven decision-making and improved business outcomes.
