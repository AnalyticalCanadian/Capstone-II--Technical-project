# Capstone-II--Technical-project
### INTRODUCTION **
------------
Today, I'm thrilled to present my project with Team Prediction on exploring machine learning concepts for flight fare data analysis. Through this project, I've delved into various techniques to gain insights into flight data dynamics, with a particular focus on the ExtraTreesRegressor technique using PyCaret.

### Background **
-----------
In the travel industry, understanding the underlying patterns and factors influencing flight fare data is crucial for airlines, travelers, and industry stakeholders. However, traditional methods often struggle to capture the complexities of this data. This project aims to address this challenge by applying advanced machine learning techniques to analyze flight data effectively.
## Presentation Candidate **
## Name: Mayank Balani
Persuing education in Business Intelligence & Data Analytics from NSCC, Halifax. I decode complex data puzzles to illuminate actionable paths.
Proficient in SQL, Python, SSMS, PostgreSQL, Power BI, Excel.

### Sample Data Selection **
-----------
For this project, I've carefully selected a dataset comprising various attributes of flight data, including departure times, airline carriers, journey durations, and more. This dataset has been meticulously cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and reliability, providing a solid foundation for our analysis.
The sample data is relevant as it represents real-world flight booking scenarios and provides the necessary attributes for training and testing regression models for fare prediction.
Sources of sample data: The dataset is sourced from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/princefrancis64/flight-price-prediction).
### Technical Technique Demonstration **
-----------
Description of the technical technique: Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (flight price) and more of independent variables (flight attributes). I've explored the ExtraTreesRegressor technique, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, to analyze flight data dynamics. Leveraging PyCaret's capabilities, I've seamlessly integrated the ExtraTreesRegressor model into the analysis pipeline, enabling efficient feature selection and insightful analysis.
### Implementation Plan **
----------
In terms of implementation, I've followed a structured approach to ensure effectiveness. This includes rigorous testing and validation of the techniques explored, as well as thorough documentation of the process. Additionally, I've collaborated with domain experts to gather feedback and iterate on the analysis for deeper insights.
### Conclusion ** 
----------
In conclusion, this project highlights the effectiveness of the ExtraTreesRegressor technique in analyzing flight data dynamics. Through our exploration, we've identified intriguing patterns and insights, with the Total_stops attribute emerging as a significant factor. These findings provide valuable insights into flight operations and can inform decision-making processes within the industry.
